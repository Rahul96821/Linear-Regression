# 📈 Linear Regression Project

A machine learning project using **Linear Regression** to model and predict outcomes based on numerical features. This project demonstrates the complete pipeline of data loading, preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), model training, evaluation, and visualization.

## 🚀 Project Overview

This repository contains an end-to-end implementation of linear regression using Python. The goal is to understand the relationship between independent variables (features) and a continuous dependent variable (target), and to make accurate predictions.

Example use cases:
- Predicting house prices based on features like square footage, number of bedrooms, etc.
- Estimating sales based on marketing spend.
- Forecasting revenue based on time series trends.


## 🧰 Tools and Technologies

- Python 
- Pandas & NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib & Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook / VSCode
